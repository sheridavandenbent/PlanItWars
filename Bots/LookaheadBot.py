"""
LookaheadBot - Another smarter kind of bot, which implements a minimax algorithm with look-ahead of two turns.
It simulates the opponent using the BullyBot strategy and simulates the possible outcomes for any
choice of source and destination planets in the attack. The simulated outcome states are ranked by
the evaluation function, which returns the most promising one.

Try to improve this bot. For example, you can try to answer some of this questions.
 - Can you come up with smarter heuristics/scores for the evaluation function?
 - What happens if you run this bot against your bot from week1?
 - How can you change this bot to beat your week1 bot?
 - Can you extend the bot to look ahead more than two turns? How many turns do you want to look ahead?
 - Is there a smart way to make this more efficient?
